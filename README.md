Abstract:
"Nutrition profoundly impacts health status across all stages of life, and unhealthy dietary
habits represent one of the most important causes of disability and premature death." [1].
Thanks to ongoing research in the field of nutritional sciences, we continue to gain a deeper
societal understanding of how our food affects us. Yet, worldwide obesity has more than
doubled since 1990 [2] and maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is still an all too uncommon
reality for much of the global population. Many factors impede this goal: increased prevalence
of ultra processed foods [3], poverty [4] and limited nutritional literacy remain among the
leading issues. Many could benefit if up to date nutritional information was delivered in an
accessible way, so that making better choices about what to eat becomes trivial.
Personalised nutritional advice can be incredibly effective in contributing to a healthy
lifestyle, as each individual has a unique set of dietary needs that they may not know exactly
how to address. The prevalent route of access to personalized advice is through nutritionists,
who can give advice, create diet plans and help manage conditions through eating. This
issue with this of course is that this is a luxury that many cannot afford, through the use of
Artificial Intelligence, I propose that these benefits can become accessible to everyone.
Creating an application which allows users to record their dietary habits, while delivering
relevant advice, teaching and help specific to an individual’s needs would allow anyone with
a smartphone to access it’s benefits. Framing the application around a LLM trained for user
interaction and nutrition expertise, would give incredible flexibility in how it could help
people diet, and provide an accessible route by which user’s could interact with the app.
